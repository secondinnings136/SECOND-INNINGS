              </h2>
              <p>
                Second Innings is a human-led mentoring and perspective platform founded to support young people (predominantly aged 16–25) through the critical transitions of education, career exploration, and adulthood.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our core methodology centers on <strong>listening, perspective, and structured reflection</strong>. The mentor acts as a trusted sounding board to help students understand context, evaluate alternatives, and identify one practical next step.

                  <strong>Not Medical Treatment:</strong> Mentoring conversations do not substitute for clinical mental healthcare, diagnosis, or crisis intervention. If a student is experiencing clinical depression, self-harm ideation, or severe distress, they must consult qualified medical professionals or crisis helplines.

              </h2>
              <p>
                Second Innings is intended for students and young adults aged 16 to 25. For any participant under the age of 18 (minors), <strong>verifiable affirmative consent from a parent or legal guardian is mandatory</strong> prior to any mentoring session.

                Parents have the right to attend an initial orientation conversation or request details regarding the framework used during discussions with their child.

              </h2>
              <p>
                A core pillar of Second Innings is <strong>student ownership</strong>. We never tell a young person which career they must choose or make pivotal life decisions on their behalf.
              </p>
              <p>
                All final academic, vocational, and personal decisions rest entirely with the student and their family. The student is solely responsible for acting on agreed next steps and conducting their own due diligence before committing to any college, course, or employer.
